# Executing Plans

## Overview

Load plan, review critically, execute all tasks, report when complete.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the executing-plans skill to implement this plan."

**Note:** Tell your human partner that Superpowers works much better with access to subagents (Claude Code, Codex CLI, Codex App, Copilot CLI, and Gemini CLI all qualify; this environment has both Claude subagents and the codex CLI). Under the `overseer` skill this skill is the OUTER LOOP ONLY — load the plan, review critically, track todos, stop on blockers — while per-task execution routes through subagent-driven-development and the overseer routing table.

## The Process

### Step 1: Load and Review Plan
1. Ensure an isolated workspace: use using-git-worktrees to create one or verify the existing one
2. Read plan file
3. Review critically - identify any questions or concerns about the plan
4. If concerns: Raise them with your human partner before starting
5. If no concerns: Create todos for the plan items and proceed

### Step 2: Execute Tasks

For each task:
1. Mark as in_progress
2. Follow each step exactly (plan has bite-sized steps)
3. Run verifications as specified
4. Mark as completed

### Step 3: Complete Development

After all tasks complete and verified:
- **REQUIRED:** Run this repo's completion gates, not a generic branch-finishing flow.
- Work the **Pre-PR checklist** in `CLAUDE.md` in order, then run `make ci-local` and
  `make up-e2e` once each (a docs-only branch may skip `up-e2e`). Green runs write the
  stamps the pre-push hook checks.
- **REQUIRED SUB-SKILL:** Use verification-before-completion before claiming any of it passed.
- Never discard, force-remove, or `--force` a worktree holding uncommitted work.
- State honestly what no local tier covers (prod domain/TLS, the China network).

## When to Stop and Ask for Help

**STOP executing immediately when:**
- Hit a blocker (missing dependency, test fails, instruction unclear)
- Plan has critical gaps preventing starting
- You don't understand an instruction
- Verification fails repeatedly

**Ask for clarification rather than guessing.**

## When to Revisit Earlier Steps

**Return to Review (Step 1) when:**
- Partner updates the plan based on your feedback
- Fundamental approach needs rethinking

**Don't force through blockers** - stop and ask.

## Remember
- Review plan critically first
- Follow plan steps exactly
- Don't skip verifications
- Reference skills when plan says to
- Stop when blocked, don't guess
- Never start implementation on main/master branch without explicit user consent
